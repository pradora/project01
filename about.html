            Gaming is a big part of my life. Offical esports record: https://bergen.edu/posts/esports-valorant-and-fifa-undeafeated/
            I have been gaming since I was 5 years old. I come from a family of immagrants so my first gaming console was an Attari. For the first few years, we were always a few generations behind, but that never stopped me from playing. My very first own gaming console was xbox 360, when I was serving in the United States Navy. In 2022 I decided to go return for a semester to persue a degree in Cyber Security, when an interesting oppurtunity presented itself: College Esports. I joined my college esports team playing Overwatch 2 and Fifa22 for the season. I went undefeated during the regular season going 6-0. But would only make it to the second round of playoffs. I currently hold the best record for FIFA at my community college. And becuase of this experience, I decided to start a company dedicated to esports: Blucifer Gaming.

            When im not busy gaming, I am usually busy learning something to do with Cyber secuirty. I have always had an interest in hacking. I have always found hackers fascinating and wanted to learn how. SO in 2021 I attended at cyber security bootcamp and have been furthering my education on the industry since. I am constantly learnig something to make a better cyber security analyst and am currently involved in a web development program to learn more.
